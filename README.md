# :dna:Virus Spreading Visualisation

### Visualising a simulation of how a virus can spreed among population, from a patient zero.
### The animation shows how people get infected, how they recover from the virus and how many people could die from the viral infection. This stops once the virus' activity is stoped, and patients had formed imunity.

### The plot of the graphical visualisation and the animations were made using the [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) library.
##### Note: I had issues running this code in the PyCharm IDE. I recommend using VS Code for optimal performance.
