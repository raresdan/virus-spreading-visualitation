# :dna:Virus Spreading Visualisation

## Overview

This project simulates the spread of a virus within a population, starting from a patient zero. The simulation provides a visual representation of how individuals get infected, recover from the virus, and the potential death toll due to the viral infection. The simulation ends when the population has developed immunity.

The simulation is powered by the Matplotlib library, and it generates graphical visualizations and animations to illustrate the virus spread dynamics.

## Prerequisites

Before running this simulation, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x üêç
- Matplotlib

## Usage

To run the simulation, execute the main script in your preferred Python environment. However, please note that I had issues when running this code in the PyCharm IDE. For optimal performance and to avoid potential problems, it is recommended to use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or another compatible IDE.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed as a learning exercise to better understand the dynamics of infectious disease spread (like COVID-19) and the Matplotlib library tools.
